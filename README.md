# MatLab-Shapes
Was a project created for CS 420 Advanced Programming Languages.

The purpose of this application is to create five shapes (circle, rectangle, square, triangle, and equilateral triangle). 
To run the application, run MyShapes. 

Shapes and SharesAppDesign are the same thing. Running Shapes will run the app created. ShapesAppDesign shows the app design code. This one features an app where you can enter numbers to create the dimensions of one of the shapes mentioned above.

ShapesV2 and ShapresAppDesignV2 are the same thing. Running ShapesV2 will run the app I created. ShapesAppDesignV2 shows the app design code. This one features an app where you use slider bars to create the dimensions of one of the shapes mentioned above.
